# ***Stroke Prediction: Harnessing the Power of Polars DataFrames***

Overview
Welcome to the Stroke Prediction Project! This project focuses on predicting strokes efficiently using Polars DataFrames, avoiding the conventional use of Pandas for streamlined data processing and analysis.

**Project Highlights**

Efficient Data Handling: Utilizing the speed and scalability of Polars DataFrames for efficient data processing.

Advanced Feature Engineering: Exploring and engineering relevant features from health datasets to enhance predictive power.

Model Development: Leveraging machine learning algorithms for stroke prediction, potentially Random Forests or Histogram Based Gradient Boosting.

Threshold Optimization: Investigating and optimizing prediction thresholds to balance precision and recall.
